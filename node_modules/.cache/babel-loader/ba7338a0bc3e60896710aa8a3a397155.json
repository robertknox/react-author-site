name=\"a__Chapter_1___Earthquake_Skies\"></a>Chapter 1 &nbsp;–\n          &nbsp;Earthquake Skies\n        </h1>\n        <p class=\"p2\">\n          I remember the earthquake had just happened a couple days before, the\n          big one in 89. &nbsp;So when the phone rang and I heard my father’s\n          voice on the other end of line, I assumed he was calling to see if I\n          had made it through in one piece, or to see if all that shaking had\n          perhaps done me some good and knocked some sense into me.\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">\n          “I’m fine.” I told him. “How about you? Did you feel it?”\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">“I felt it,” he said.</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">\n          “Parts of the freeway collapsed. Buildings in the Marina District\n          &nbsp;fell. It turns out most the Marina is a garbage dump made of\n          fill from the last earthquake in 1906. It is a graveyard of those old\n          buildings. It turned to jello during the quake. But here in North\n          Beach there wasn’t a lot of damage. It is all on bedrock. Is\n          everything OK out there?”\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">“That’s what I wanted to talk to you about.”</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">“Oh?” I asked.</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">\n          Both our voices dropped down in pitch a little at that point.\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">\n          I assumed the worst. During those first few days after the quake if\n          you happened to bump into someone’s table at a restaurant, making it\n          shake as if the floor were moving, a wave of absolute panic would come\n          over the person’s face. There is no power like the ground buckling\n          underneath your feet. It is the power of God, and God has a Hell of\n          sense of humor. After the earthquake there were 21 aftershocks. God’s\n          version of a whoopee cushion. God is such a joker.\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">“Why don’t you come over for a beer?” he asked.</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">“Tonight?”</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">“Yes, tonight.”</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">So I did.</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">\n          It started me wondering. Images of his house, the house in which I was\n          raised, lying in rubble came into my mind. A lot of windows had been\n          broken around the Bay in a lot of houses. I thought about the big\n          salon-window in the living-room that looks onto the front yard. It\n          would produce long shards of thick glass that could cut off a hand, or\n          slice a face. I remembered, as a child of five or six, I had pushed my\n          mouth and face up against that window pretending to be a fish in an\n          aquarium at Sea World. &nbsp;I remember my father saying: “That will\n          leave a mark. Someone will have to clean it.” I wondered if the\n          earthquake had left more than a little grease mark. I wondered if the\n          window had cracked and all the fish had been let out of the aquarium\n          and were lying dead on the front porch.\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">\n          Driving past the Embarcadero I saw chunks of concrete that lay broken\n          and twisted to the side of road, exposing the evenly spaced iron\n          re-bar, like a dead animal, lying on its back, cut open, exposing its\n          ribs, as if Old Mr. Earthquake had gone hunting for freeways, found\n          one, killed it and left the corpse lying out in the sun. I remember\n          thinking that if the earthquake had done all that to the freeway, what\n          had it done to my father’s little house?\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">\n          But when I pulled up and knocked on the door, the house seemed fine.\n          The big bay window was reflecting a brownish yellow glare from the\n          street light in the front yard. About three feet up from the skirt of\n          bricks on the porch I saw the spot against which I had pushed my lips\n          and played fish-in-the-aquarium a long time ago shining like it had\n          just been cleaned and polished.\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">\n          “Beer?” he asked. “Let’s go out to the backyard. We can look up at the\n          stars and hear the crickets,” he said. I walked through the living\n          room and the kitchen and then out to the back patio, inspecting the\n          walls, the molding and the ceiling for damage as I went. It was almost\n          dusk and an unusual shade of red hung in the sky. Blood red with a\n          little orange mixed in. It was late October and should have been much\n          colder.\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">\n          He handed me a beer, a Coors. That was his beer. We sat down on two\n          folding lounge chairs at the edge of the grass, resting our beers on\n          the circular red metal table at the edge of the concrete and looked up\n          at the sky. I remember the grass smelled as if it had been freshly\n          cut.\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">\n          I inspected the stucco on the back of the house for problems.\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">“The house seems fine,” I said.</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">\n          “It is. There is a crack in the drywall of one or the bedrooms, but I\n          can fix that.”\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">“That’s a relief.”</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">“We hardly felt it. A little shaking … that’s all.”</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">“I was worried.”</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">\n          My eyes had been preoccupied with the house, and I hadn’t really taken\n          a good look at him, but now for the first time, I looked at his face\n          and it scared me. It was gaunt, and his normally ruddy complexion had\n          turned to a color best described as ash. There was &nbsp;a sallowness\n          to his face that surfaced in patches and seemed to float around like\n          driftwood on that sea of gray. I guessed he had lost 70 pounds,\n          perhaps more, since I had last seen him, which had been several years.\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">\n          “There are some things I wanted to talk to you about, that’s all.\n          Things you should know.”\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">He looked up at the sky.</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">“I hate being dramatic,” he said.</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">\n          He had always been very stocky. His jeans had been perennially\n          stretched about the thigh, but now they were bunched up around the\n          plaid nylon fabric of the lounge chair. I could have grabbed a handful\n          of excess material. I could have grabbed two. He was wearing a navy\n          blue button up short sleeve shirt, and the &nbsp;cloth seemed to fall\n          straight down from his shoulders and collect around his belt. I had\n          never seen a shirt hang on him that way. &nbsp;I didn’t know why I\n          hadn’t noticed it when I had first walked into the house.\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">“What is it?” I asked.</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">He took a big breath.</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">\n          “There are some logistics we need to talk about. Then there are some\n          personal things …”\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">\n          All of a sudden, I realized something was very wrong, very wrong\n          indeed.\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">“Did anything fall on you?”</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">\n          I knew the answer before I had asked the question. The transformation\n          I was seeing had been a long time coming. It hadn’t &nbsp;happened in\n          a couple of days, and I knew it as soon as I felt the words escaping\n          from my mouth.\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">\n          “No. The house shook a little. To tell you the truth I didn’t think\n          anything of it until I turned on the TV that night.”\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">I nodded.</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">\n          The day had almost turned into night by then, but that red, swollen,\n          irritated sky refused to leave. It should have been cold, but it\n          wasn’t. It should have been windy, but it wasn’t. October is &nbsp;a\n          breezy month in the Bay. Heat from the central valley sucks the cold\n          air coming off the ocean eastward. It is one of the reasons sailing is\n          so well regarded in the Bay. I had began to hear people call it\n          earthquake weather. &nbsp;Some had began to call these calm, blood\n          red, windless skies “earthquake skies.” It was too warm. Too quiet.\n          Too calm. People had began to speculate that this strange weather had\n          produced the earthquake. Something to do with an abundance of magnetic\n          ions within the earth's crust. I’m still not clear if the ions were\n          the symptom or the cause.\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">“Then what is it?” I asked.</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">\n          He shook his head and then looked up at the sky. It was a beautiful\n          sky.\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">“The big C.”</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">“The big C?”</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">“Cancer,” he said. “Just Cancer.”</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">He smiled.</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">\n          I realized without ever thinking about it, I had assumed that he would\n          live forever. It was an assumption I had made at a very young age and\n          never gotten around to revising. &nbsp;\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">\n          It felt like someone had turned on a blender inside my gut. It is a\n          moment I will remember for the rest of my life because I froze. I\n          turned into a block of ice right there in my chair. I didn’t know how\n          to respond. I didn’t know if I should be sad or encouraging or hopeful\n          or regretful or concerned or angry or empathetic. Finally, I chose\n          hopeful. It was really more or less a random choice.\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">\n          “Now days there are amazing things they can do … treatments,” I said.\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">He smiled and shook his head.</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">“No.”</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">“Why?”</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">“Already tried.”</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">“They are coming up with new things all the time ...”</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">He just shook his head.</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">\n          No one said anything for awhile. I wanted to ask what he meant\n          exactly. Was he dying? Did he have one month, ten months, five years?\n          But I kept quiet. It was his party. His show. His sky ... that warm\n          evening in October.\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\n        <p class=\"p10\">\n          “There are some things I need to tell you,” he said. I was still in\n          shock, but from his tone, he seemed to be talking about mowing lawns,\n          or giving directions to the supermarket. The last of the bloody\n          redness in the west was leaking out of the sky.\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"p10\">“OK,” I said.</p>\n        <p class=\"p10\">\n          “Not now. &nbsp;It's not the right time. &nbsp;It has to be the right\n          moment ...”\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"p10\">“All right.”</p>\n        <p class=\"p10\">\n          “Important things. I should warn you … you might not like what I have\n          to say,” he said.\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"p10\">I nodded.</p>\n        <p class=\"p10\">\n          It is hardly ever warm like that in late October. It could even have\n          been November at that point. To tell you the truth I can’t be sure.\n          Shock and grief has a way of fiddling with memory, bending it a\n          little, but I believe it was still October at that point.\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"p10\">\n          I remember the stars came out and we stared up at them for a long time\n          without saying anything. It was the same sky I remembered from my\n          childhood. I had always assumed it would never change, that it would\n          last forever. But at that moment I wasn’t sure if it would be there\n          the next evening. Everything seemed to be going to Hell in those last\n          few weeks of October.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          I had read somewhere that it takes millions of years for the light of\n          a star to reach this planet. So what we are seeing when we look up in\n          the sky is millions of years old. It was like that with our\n          relationship as well, it took a long time for the light to reach us. I\n          think in the very end we saw it, saw the light, so to speak, at least\n          I would like to think so. I told him I would be back the next weekend,\n          and the week-end after that, and the week-end after that. And I was.\n        </p>\n        <p>&nbsp;</p>\n      </>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default Ferns;\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
